This directory of test files contains a modified gpubox file from MWA Phase 1 for obs id 1101503312. The purpose of these files is to verify the conversion from the legacy correlator format to the expected baseline, freq, pol format (like the new MWAX correlator). 

* 1101503312_20141201210818_gpubox01_00.fits: This gpubox file only has a PRIMARY HDU and the first timestep HDU in order to save disk space on github. In addition, the HDU is a ImgCompHdu (compressed HDU) to further reduce size. The compression is lossless and this only works on data taken > Oct 2014. 
* 1101503312_full_matrix.csv: This is an independently generated matrix of all of the source elements form the input HDU to make the output HDU. This is an intermediate step in generating the conversion table we use when converting and this is used in tests.
* 1101503312_gpubox01_pyuvdata_1st_timestep.csv: This is ouput from a custom python program using pyuvdata. This file is assumed to be correct.
* 1101503312.metafits: The metafits for this observation as generated by the web service. Note: it has not been adjusted to reflect only 1 timestep.

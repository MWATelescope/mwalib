This directory of test files contains a modified metafits file which only has 2 rf_inputs (1101503312.metafits) for the purposes of testingLegacy VCS voltage context functionality. Limiting to 2 rfinputs (1 tile) reduces the test file size generated by the tests.
There is also an unmodified metafits: 1101503312.metafits128 which is only used once to test for the ordering of antennas and rfinputs.
